# RainbowCanyonIncisionKnickpoint
This code computes the incision of a canyon into a tableland. The canyon incises in response to uplift. The incision model is the Sklar-Dietrich saltation abrasion formulation. The canyon model captures upstream migration of a knickpoint at the canyon-tableland junction, and sediment contribution from collapsing canyon walls.
